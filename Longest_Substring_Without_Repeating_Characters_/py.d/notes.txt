How to solve this?:
------------------
------------------

- construct map:
  - key = char
  - val = list of indices

- if all index arrays == 1
  - we return the length of the string (all chars unique)

- what do we do with our map of char -> array of indices ?
  - we are looking for the longest substring of non repeat chars
  - if we start with the assumption that the substring of s:
    - s[0:len(s)-1]
    - we are interested in determining whether s[0]

- testing substring s[0]
